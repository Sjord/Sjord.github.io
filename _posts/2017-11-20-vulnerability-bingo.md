I made a script to generate random bingo cards with vulnerabilities on it. Now you can play [vulnerability bingo](https://github.com/Sjord/vulnbingo).

## Running the script

    git clone https://github.com/Sjord/vulnbingo
    cd vulnbingo
    mkvirtualenv -p $(which python3) vulnbingo
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python vulnbingo.py

This creates a file `output.docx` which contains your randomized bingo card. The `vulnbingo.py` script puts the vulnerabilities listed in `vulns.txt` in the `template.docx` file and writes it to `output.docx`.
