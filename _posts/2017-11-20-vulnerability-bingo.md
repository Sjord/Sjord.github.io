I made a script to generate random bingo cards with vulnerabilities on it. Now you can play vulnerability bingo.

## Bingo!

I wrote a script that makes a random bingo card where each cell contains a vulnerability type instead of a number. Now you can play bingo with your colleagues. Cross out the vulnerabilities you find and see who is the first the get five in row.

This can also help to look for vulnerabilities that you wouldn't normally focus on. It is a fun way to have a checklist of 25 vulnerabilities.

[Download your randomized bingo card here.](https://demo.sjoerdlangkemper.nl/vulnbingo.php)

## Running the script

You can find the script [on GitHub](https://github.com/Sjord/vulnbingo).

    git clone https://github.com/Sjord/vulnbingo
    cd vulnbingo
    mkvirtualenv -p $(which python3) vulnbingo
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python vulnbingo.py

This creates a file `output.docx` which contains your randomized bingo card. The `vulnbingo.py` script puts the vulnerabilities listed in `vulns.txt` in the `template.docx` file and writes it to `output.docx`.
