In a risk assessment, total risk is often calculated as a product of probability and impact. To make a proper risk assessment of cyber attacks, companies need to know both the probability and the impact of cyber attacks. This article explores the impact. What are the consequences of getting hacked?

## Possible negative results of a hack

A company that gets hacked experiences many cost factors. It takes work to recover from the hack. Users may lose trust in the company and take their business elsewhere. Later on in this article we will look at these possible damages from a hack:

* cost of investigating the hack;
* cost of reinstalling systems and otherwise recovering technically;
* brand damage and loss of sales;
* lost revenue due to denial of service;
* loss of intelectual property or valuable data;
* legal defense;
* fines.

### Overview

But first, let's look at what studies say the monetary damage of a hack is on average.

monetary costs reported by the respondents are for all cybercrime types quite low. -- lp16

Among the 46 per cent of businesses that detected breaches in the last 12 months, the survey finds that the average business faces costs of £ 1,570 as a result of these breaches.  -- ip17

job in China, according to press reports. This the represented about one-eighth of Valspar’s reported profits in 2009, the year the employee was arrested. fecie11
