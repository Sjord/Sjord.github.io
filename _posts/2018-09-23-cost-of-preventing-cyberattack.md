## Solving vulnerabilities is insufficient

Rescorla has argued that for software with many latent vulnerabilities (e.g., Windows), removing one bug makes little difference to the likelihood of an attacker finding another one later (11).

rather than focusing only on finding zero-day vulnerabilities, defenders may be able to shift the balance in their favor by starting from the assumption of compromise, investigating ways to improve system architecture design to contain the impact of compromise, and adopting different techniques to identify vulnerabilities. ablon17

## Make a plan

Involve marketeers whitler2017

## Invest in detection

To reduce investigation costs, and to reduce length of hack.

## Treat data as a liability

Delete unused data.

## Defend in depth

Don't only defend the outer perimiter.
