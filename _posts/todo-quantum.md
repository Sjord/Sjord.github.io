Quantum computers work with quantum bits. Normal bits can only be one or zero, but quantum bits can also be in a _superposition_: both one and zero at the same time. This can be used to perform computations that are not possible in the non-quantum, classical world. In this post, we are particularly interested in how this can be used to break crypto. This is possible with quantum computing because it can perform some calculations dramatically faster than classical computers. Quantum computers are not faster at everything, but for some tasks the superposition can be used to perform calculations on all possible inputs simultanously. This is called quantum parallelism. I will explain it using cats in boxes.

Some scientists proposed that on a very small scale, particles can be in a superposition. Schr√∂dinger made this more tangible by connecting the particle to a cat in a closed box. The particle and the cat are connected in some way, such that the cat is either alive or dead, depending on the particle. In a classical world, when you open the box and you see a dead cat, you know that the cat has been dead all along. However, in a quantum world, the cat is in a superposition. It is both alive and dead at the same time until you open the box. When you open the box and look inside, only then the universe determines the fate of the cat.

This seems strange to most people. This is because quantum particles act like nothing in the classical world. In fact, quantum particles don't act like cats in boxes. This also means that most of this article is factually incorrect, but it may still give you some feeling about how quantum calculations work.

## Cracking passwords with cats

Imagine we have a password protected laptop, and we want to crack the password. We could try every password until we get the correct one, but that would take a very long time. Instead, we may be able to use quantum to speed up the process.

We put the laptop along with the cat in the box. We instructed the cat beforehand to enter a random password. When we close the box, there is a superposition of cats that all try a different random password. In each parallel universe, the cat tries a different password. It is as if the cat in the box tries each password in parallel. However, as soon as we open the box, the state collapses and we end up with a classical situation. The cat tried only one password and it was probably the wrong one.

Now we do the same again, but we instruct the cat to enter a random password and climb out of the box if it is the correct one. We close the box, the cat is again in a superposition. However, this time the box opens and collapses to the state we want: the cat has entered the correct password. We obtained the password instantly, and in the classical world the password was just entered once. We used quantum parallelism to get lucky the first time.

## Cat trees

Actually, it doesn't really work like that. We can't tell the cat with the correct password to come out of the box. Remember, as soon as we look in the box the quantum state collapses and we end up with just one cat that tried one password. The test whether we have the correct password is similar to looking in the box. We can't use if-statements when instructing the cats.



## Conclusion

No cats were hurt in the making of this blog post.
