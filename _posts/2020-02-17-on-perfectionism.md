## What is perfectionism for me

Perfectionism may sound nice, like you try to do everything perfectly. For me it is more like quality anxiety. Or more accurately, imagined criticism anxiety. I think about what negative feedback I make a mistake, that people may think less of me if I am not productive enough, or that people are disappointed in me when I deliver imperfect results. This mostly happens in my head. I am my own worst critic.

The effect is that I try to avoid making mistakes, and this comes at a high cost. Here are some of my solutions to not make mistakes:

* Don't start projects. A project not started is a project not failed.
* Don't finish projects. If it is not finished, it can't be reasonably judged, so nobody can say its imperfect.
* Don't participate in games. In most games, there is a possibility to loose, which you totally avoid if you don't participate in the first place.
* Don't make appointments. This way, you never have to bear the social awkwardness of cancelling an appointment.
* Don't engage in social interactions. Don't introduce yourself to new people. Don't congratulate people when it's their birthday.
* Spend too much time on things to make them perfect, and then still be unhappy both about the result and the amount of invested time.

Most of these are obviously are not absolutes. I do start and finish some projects, and this blog is good evidence that I occasionally expose myself to imagined criticism.
