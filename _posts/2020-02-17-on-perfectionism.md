## What perfectionism means

Perfectionism may sound nice, like you try to do everything perfectly. For me it is more like quality anxiety. Or more accurately, imagined criticism anxiety. I think about what negative feedback I make a mistake, that people may think less of me if I am not productive enough, or that people are disappointed in me when I deliver imperfect results. This mostly happens in my head. I am my own worst critic.

The effect is that I try to avoid making mistakes, and this comes at a high cost. Here are some of my solutions to not make mistakes:

* Don't start projects. A project not started is a project not failed.
* Don't finish projects. If it is not finished, it can't be reasonably judged, so nobody can say its imperfect.
* Don't participate in games. In most games, there is a possibility to loose, which you totally avoid if you don't participate in the first place.
* Don't make appointments. This way, you never have to bear the social awkwardness of cancelling an appointment.
* Don't engage in social interactions. Don't introduce yourself to new people. Don't congratulate people when it's their birthday.
* Spend too much time on things to make them perfect, and then still be unhappy both about the result and the amount of invested time.

Most of these are obviously are not absolutes. I do start and finish some projects, and this blog is good evidence that I occasionally expose myself to imagined criticism.

One of the most frustrating perfectionist thoughts I have is "if only I had done that differenly". When I made a mistake, I wish that I could go back in time and do things differently. Of course I can't, and I am angry and disappointed with myself for making a mistake.

## Playing down your own thoughts

A helpful thing to realize is that I am not my thoughts. The thoughts that pop in my head are not deliberate or true. Brene Brown describes this as having gremlins in your head. When you think a negative irrational thought, it's not you that made it up, it's a little gremlin that lives in your head. Its job is to mess things up. To tease you. While you can't get rid of the gremlin, you can identify that it came from him and interpret it accordingly.

Our brains are evolved for efficient hunting and gathering, and remaining alive on the savannah of Africa. At that time, being part of a tribe was of crucial importance. If your tribe thought you were weird and cast you away, you would have to hunt and gather all by yourself and you would probably not live long. Therefore, the brain evolved to be socially cautious, to the point of social anxiety. Realizing that you have a 50,000 year old brain can help a bit with interpreting things it says.

As you have gremlins and mammoths in your head, thoughts are best taken with a grain of salt. You can't really trust anything you think, so best not to get too worked up about your own thoughts.
