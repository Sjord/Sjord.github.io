At scouting we have workbench with a vice. The handle of the vice was missing and I wanted to make a new one. To do so I tried to make a lathe. I put two screws in a piece of wood. I fastened one screw in the drill press and the other could turn freely in another piece of wood. The thing could then turn and I could hold my chisel to it to make it round.

It didn't go so well, particularly because the chisel I had was not sharp enough and probably not suited for the job. Also, when the turning wood jammed against the chisel, the screw would unscrew itself a bit and the wood would get loose from the drill. But it was nice to try to make something.
