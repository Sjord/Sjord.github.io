In my post [From developer to pentester](/2017/08/16/from-developer-to-pentester/) I described how I switched from a job as software developer to a job as security tester. Since I wrote that post I get asked a lot about how to learn pentesting as a developer and how to make the switch to pentester. This article describes how I learned enough security to get a job, and then some more.

## How to become a hacker

I am not an expert in this area. I switched from developer to pentester only once and it took me more than a decade, so I may not be an authority in this field. However, here is what helped me to become a pentester. 

### Create a web application

When I switched to pentesting I had already more than 15 years experience in developing web applications, and that knowledge still helps a great deal when hacking web applications. Programming gives me insight in how (web) applications work. I have an idea how an application works and why it works like it does, because I have programmed something like that before myself. This gives a huge advantage as a pentester. I try to exploit things that I think are in the application, based on my experience as developer.

Experience in programming also helps with giving recommendations to developers about how to fix security vulnerabilities, because you have seen their side of the story.

To learn hacking web application hacking, [create a simple web application](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/intro/tutorial01/) yourself. This proces teaches you about how they work and helps you hack them. It also gives more empathy for software developers to which you report vulnerabilities.

### Focus on security in your current job

If you currently have a job, for example as developer or system administrator, you already can integrate information security in your job. I learned the most about security while paying attention to it while I was developing web applications. I just read a lot of articles on the internet and tried to improve my programming. Applying what you learn makes sure you really understand it well, and it broadens the knowledge of your current work. And you can start with this immediately.

### Get certified

I get often asked about certifications. I didn't do any hacking courses or certifications.

One good certification that really tests if you are capable of pentesting is OSCP. That certification really involves hands-on hacking and can be trusted to indicate competence. However, it is not really targeted at beginners.

On the other hand the CEH certification is not a good indication of somebody's knowledge. It looks good on your resume but it doesn't indicate actual competence of anything, it is just something to impress HR people with.

Another certification that may be interesting for you is the eWPT and eWPTX. This is focused on web applications only. However, it is not as well known as the OSCP so it doesn't reflect as well on your resume.

Instead of getting a certification it is also possible to find vulnerabilities in open source software or bug bounties and put that on your resume to show you are a capable hacker. However, I don't really understand the job market, so I am not the best to give you advice on this.

### Read about hacks

I read a lot of blog posts about hacks, especially those posted on [/r/netsec](https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec). I find the blog posts containing code or other technical details particularly interesting. I have listed a few [here](/2016/08/19/recent-web-hacks/).

### Practice hacking

There are a lot of [practice sites](/2018/12/19/practice-hacking-with-vulnerable-systems/) and I also practice on real web applications that I run on my own computer. I think this experience of figuring out how real web applications work is very important to hack them. I don't really do bug bounties.

I think a good starting point is to learn about the vulnerabilities in the OWASP top 10. You can also do little hacking exercises such as the XSS game.

To learn pentesting you need to practice a lot, both on hacking exercies and real web applications. You need to get a feeling about what vulnerabilities are where and how to find them. You have an edge as a developer since you can use the code to find and exploit vulnerabilities.

I learned very much on the job. I am doing a different project every week, and I learn something from every project. I am eager to learn and I think this is rewarding, but it takes effort and it is not for everyone.

### Do research

I feel that in the infosec field there is very much to learn, even more so than with developing software. Sometimes between projects there is a little time to research or learn something, and I occasionally research some stuff at home. Especially when I just started I was learning a lot in my own time. For me, this was mostly because I was very interested and keen on learning new things, but I can understand that it is hard when you don't have as much time. When I started I tried to write a blog post every week, which is pretty demanding but also made me learn at a quick pace.
