In my post [From developer to pentester](2017/08/16/from-developer-to-pentester/) I described how I switched from a job as software developer to a job as security tester. The question I get asked most about this is: "how did you learn pentesting?" This article describes how I learned enough security to get a job, and then some more.

## Learn how web applications work

When I switched to pentesting I had already more than 15 years experience in developing web applications, and that knowledge still helps a great deal when hacking web applications. However, that doesn't help you much, since you probably don't want to spend 15 years before getting into penetration testing. My path is pretty unique and doesn't offer good advice for other people trying to learn penetration testing.

I didn't do any formal training. I haven't done any certification. I hear OSCP is good, but it isn't really for beginners.

I read a lot of blog posts about hacks (/r/netsec, twitter, blog) and I always practiced a lot. There are a lot of practice sites and I also practice on real web applications that I run on my own computer. I think this experience of figuring out how real web applications work is very important to hack them. I don't really do bug bounties.
