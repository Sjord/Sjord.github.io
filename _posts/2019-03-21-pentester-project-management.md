## Creating directory structure

It creates the following directories:

* `burp` stores the Burp project and log.
* `poc` is for proof of concept scripts. For example, a HTML file that demonstrates CSRF ends up here.
* `code` has any available source code.
* `screenshots` has all screenshots for this project.
* `project` has the project information such as the proposal.
* `bin` has some project specific scripts which I will explain below.

And finally, it creates a file `notes.txt` which is to contain all notes made during the project.
