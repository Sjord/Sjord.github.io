When doing a project I want to keep all project data in one directory. I keep notes and logs to make reporting easier, and to be able to answer customer questions. Altough it's rare, sometimes it is necessary to go back through the logs to see what happened during the test. In that case you want the logs to be complete, and contain only information from that project. To make this easier, I have partly automated a workflow I will explain below.

## Requirements

The goal of my workflow is to easily store project data in the project folder, and to prevent contamination with other projects or non-project related work. 

## Using a virtual machine


## Creating directory structure

It creates the following directories:

* `burp` stores the Burp project and log.
* `code` has any available source code.
* `screenshots` has all screenshots for this project.
* `project` has the project information such as the proposal.
* `bin` has some project specific scripts which I will explain below.

And finally, it creates a file `notes.txt` which is to contain all notes made during the project.

## Symlink for current project



## Saving screenshots



## Firefox profile

## Burp configuration

## Archiving
