## Introduction

Wherever a string has some structure to it, it can be vulnerable to injection. When creating CSV, JSON, HTML, URL, or some other structured text, just putting a variable in it without encoding or escaping it can break the format, and result in a security issue. The naive way to solve this is to escape the variable. The better way is to create an object, and convert that to text.

## URL example

You can create a URL like this:

```javascript
const url = 'https://example.org/?error=' + errorMsg;
```

This goes wrong if `errorMsg` contains characters that have special meaning in a URL. The most obvious example here would be an ampersand, `&`, which can be used to add another parameter.

This can be solved by using escaping:

```javascript
const url = 'https://example.org/?error=' + encodeURIComponent(errorMsg);
```

There are a few disadvantages with this:
* you have to use the correct escaping method.
* you have to remember to do it every time.

Another method is to use the URL API:

```javascript
const url = new URL('https://example.org/')
url.searchParams.append('error', errorMsg);
```

By creating an object using an API, all values are automatically encoded. This way, it is impossible to create an invalid URL, or to forget escaping, or use the incorrect escaping.

## HTML templates

Similarly, HTML is structured text and can be vulnerable to injection. The advice is to use a template engine, but even then there are several levels of escaping.

Most template engines are text-based with automatic escaping. The variable is automatically encoded and then interpolated in the rest of the template, as a string.

An alternative is to parse the template as a superset of HTML into a DOM, walk the DOM to replace the variables, and serialize it back to HTML. Angular does it this way. This is the most secure against injection. Consider this example:

```
<body class={{ variable }}>
```

If *variable* contains whitespace, this introduces a problem for a text-based template engine. However, a DOM-based template engine just assigns the variable content to the *body.class* property, whitespace and all.

## Conclusion

Using the correct data types can help in securing both input and output values. By constructing objects instead of concatenating strings, injection is made impossible.
