* What to expect when you succeed?

* Hacking other people is illegal, that's why you should set up your own systems to hack.
* Several fields available:
    * Hardware / firmware
        * IoT
        * Cars
        * Airplanes
    * Web applications
    * Windows networks
    * Non-HTTP services
    * Crypto
    * Intrusion detection/prevention
    * Blue/red teaming
    Some possible branches:
		* Vulnerability management (blue team) stuff that you do already... patching, antivirus, access control, vulnerability scanning, etc. SANS 20 critical controls will help here
		* Policy creation, management, exceptions, and compliance (PCI, HIPAA, export controls, internal company security policies, SOx)
		* Audits and assessments
		* Network security. Firewalls, VPN (2-factor authentication!), proxy, limiting ingress/egress
		* Incident response
		* Monitoring
		* Project management
		* Server and cloud security (make sure users aren't sending confidential data to dropbox, lol)
		* Forensics and investigations

* Understand how things work
    * Not just how it is supposed to work, but all edge cases
* Think about ways to accomplish something that works, but isn't supposed to

* Create a web application yourself
* Understand HTTP
    Same-origin policy
    Cookies
    JavaScript
* Set up VMs or docker containers
* Proxies, load balancers, firewalls
* Use a web proxy (fiddler, ZAP, burp, wireshark)
* Optionally obtain CVE numbers for your resume
* Keep yourself informed
