I want to be a good hacker, and one way to learn the skills is by reading books. Last week I read a new book and this post will describe what I think about this book.

The book I read was [Hacking and Pen Testing: Become an Expert in Computer Hacking and Security](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M28RIR1/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01M28RIR1&linkCode=as2&tag=sjoerdlangkem-20&linkId=5ada83125eca515f45d2edc5d911fd5d) by James Smith.

## Superficial 

It is a pretty short book, about sixty pages. This can be a good thing, as not everyone feels like reading 900 pages of material as in the case of the [Web Application Hacker's Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118026470/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1118026470&linkCode=as2&tag=sjoerdlangkem-20&linkId=ac510fae3ff0d665b3f9a36c97a81676). If you pick a small subject to write about, you can end up with a small book that is still good. The book "Hacking and Pen Testing", however, tries to describe everything: social engineering, DDoS, phreaking, TCP/IP, TOR, password cracking, virtual machines, WiFi cracking. Because there is so much crammed in so little book everything has just a little paragraph and nothing is covered in depth.

I think a book should be more than [a collection of blog posts](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470395354/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0470395354&linkCode=as2&tag=sjoerdlangkem-20&linkId=7906163ab3aef411a21624892f1aadc3). A book gives the writer the chance to get in much more detail. "Hacking and Pen Testing" squanders the opportunity by touching all subjects briefly and lacking a story or any cohesion at all.

## Chaotic

When I started this book, I thought it would make me a hacker. It even says so on the front, "Become an Expert in Computer Hacking and Security". In chapter 2, however, the book becomes defensive. It describes how I can protect against social engineering by training my employees. This does not belong in a book that makes me a hacker.

The book clearly focusses on beginners, but does a bad job of explaining basic things to them:

> Worms dig tunnels through computer networks, looking for systems with exploitable vulnerabilities and infecting these.

Although it is a nice metaphor that worms wiggle along your network cable, the reality is that they don't "dig" any "tunnels". Here is another confusing example:

> A network analyzer is like an IDS is like a firewall which is like a router, except not.

## Dull

The book would have been a little more fun to read if it had contained some real-life examples. Some little anecdote about how this one company got hacked because the secretary put in an untrusted USB-drive, or something like that. That makes the theory relatable. There is one anecdote in the book about a job site where the workers had to have security clearances but the cleaners did not. That puts the security rules in perspective, but sadly this is one of the few stories and it is written in just one sentence.

## Incomplete

It does not mention XSS, CSRF, OWASP, hashcat or Nessus. There is a link to Burp, but that's the only mention to it.

## Conclusion

Don't read it.
