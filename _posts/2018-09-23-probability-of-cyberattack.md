It follows that the unconditional probability of a cyberattack in a given year for a firm in our sample is extremely low, as it is 0.32%. kamiya2018

Higher risk for:
* larger companies kamiya2018
* companies with lower leverage kamiya2018
* poor past stock performance kamiya2018
* more intangible assets kamiya2018

Lower risk for:
* companies with a risk committee on the board kamiya2018


Many victims of economic espionage are unaware of the crime until years after loss of the information. fecie11

There is almost no defense against a zero-day attack: while the vulnerability remains unknown, the software affected cannot be patched and anti-virus products cannot detect the attack through signature-based scanning. bilge2012

For a given stockpile of zero-day vulnerabilities, after a year, approximately 5.7 percent have been discovered by an outside entity. ablon17

At the most basic level, any serious attacker can always get an a ordable zero-day for almost any target.  ablon17

The NSA routinely receives – or intercepts – routers, servers and other computer network devices being exported from the US before they are delivered to the international customers. The agency then implants backdoor surveillance tools, repackages the devices with a factory seal and sends them on. The NSA thus gains access to entire networks and all their users. gg14

If an organisation is co nnec ted to the internet, it is vulnerable. The incidents in the public eye are just the tip of the iceberg. -- acsc15

The hackers, reportedly from China, maintained their stealth presence in OPM's networks for more than a year before being discovered. -- wh15

business - related c ybercrime was quite prevalent in 2015 - 2016 and affected large and medium - size businesses more frequently than small ones -- lp16

Just under half (46%) of all UK businesses identified at least one cyber security breach or attack in the last 12 months. This rises to two - thirds among 
medium firms (66%) and large firms (68%). - ip17

The likelihood of a data breach involving a minimum of 10,000 records is estimated at approximately 27.9 percent over a 24-month period.  - ponemon18
The likelihood is based on the companies participating in the study. These companies had a data breach which makes it more likely they will have another. - susan

    You’re more likely to experience a data breach of at least 10,000 records (27.9 percent) than you are to catch the flu this winter (5–20 percent, according to WebMD).
