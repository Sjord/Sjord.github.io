## Keep to your job

In every company a lot of things can be improved. Maybe reporting usually takes longer than scheduled, or sales is always late with the signed contract, or the paper in the printer jams every monday. Don't concern yourself with all these things. Concern yourself with doing your job. You have a limited amount of control over the company, and trying to fix the whole company by yourself will get you frustrated.

If you have the feeling that you have some room left to worry about other things, pick one problem at a time to solve. Make sure that it is solvable by you. Worrying about problems that you can't solve only brings you stress.

## Have something besides your job

If you are very invested in your job and try to get all meaning in life through your work, it puts you at risk when something bad happens with your job. Instead, invest time in a hobby, art, religion, sports, music, family, relationships, so that your work is not your only source of engagement in life.

## Consider the silent mass

Events or people that are very good or very bad stand out, and you are likely to focus on these. You may be annoyed by that one coworker who seems to slack off all day. However, keep in mind that for every annoying slacker there are ten people who do just do their job and don't get noticed. The people that don't stand out are probably the majority of your collegues and you should give them a fair part of attention.

## Don't fall for imposter syndrome

One thing I have noticed is that in infosec some people have a certain smug character trait in that they won't admit they don't know something and they are always boasting their technical knowledge. This can give the impression that they are much smarter than you, but this is just show. Don't fall for it.

## Have a positive contribution to the world

A feeling that you matter is important for most people. That you contribute something to society. This can be through your job and you should think about this when looking for a job. However, it can also be outside of the job, for example by maintaining open source software, helping in a community center, or writing blog posts. An alternative is to donate a portion of your earnings to charity. This way, you can do a lot of good while not spending more time.

## Get to know yourself

Get to know yourself. Know your strengths and weaknesses.

One thing that bothered me was my own perfectionism. It took quite a while to recognize this of myself, and that it was a bad fit with software development. So it's not necessarily that software development is stupid, but more that the combination of software development and my character gave troubles for me.

## Don't try to find the perfect job

Don't let perfect be the enemy of good when it comes to a job. Don't get annoyed with little things in your job. Don't get stuck in negativity over a few things that don't work so well.

That said, as soon as you really don't like your job, start looking for a new job. It's pretty hard to know upfront what a job is going to be like, so you have to try it out and switch jobs if it doesn't work.

## Conclusion
