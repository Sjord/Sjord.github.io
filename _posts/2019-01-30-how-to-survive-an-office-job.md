## How to survive an office job

### Worry about your job

In every company a lot of things can be improved. Maybe reporting structurally takes longer than scheduled, or sales is always late with the signed contract, or the paper in the printer jams every monday. Don't concern yourself with all these things. Concern yourself with doing your job. 

If you have the feeling that you have some room left to worry about other things, pick one problem at a time to solve. Make sure that it is solvable by you. Worrying about problems that you can't solve only brings you stress.

One reason for that is that the outcome of a project is more in my own hands. I have a project about every week and although the company is swamped with work, I just do my projects one at a time.

### Consider the silent mass

Events or people that are very good or very bad stand out, and you are likely to focus on these.

### Don't fall for imposter syndrome

One thing I have noticed is that in infosec some people have a certain smug character trait in that they won't admit they don't know something and they are always boasting their technical knowledge. This can give the impression that they are much smarter than you, but this is just show. Don't fall for it.

### Get to learn yourself

Get to know yourself. Know your strengths and weaknesses.

One thing that bothered me was my own perfectionism. It took quite a while to recognize this of myself, and that it was a bad fit with software development. So it's not necessarily that software development is stupid, but more that the combination of software development and my character gave troubles for me.

### Don't try to find the perfect job

As soon as you don't like your job, start looking for a new job. It's pretty hard to know upfront what a job is going to be like, so you have to try it out and switch jobs if it doesn't work.
