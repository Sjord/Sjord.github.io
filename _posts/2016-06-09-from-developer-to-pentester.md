Last year I switched from developing web applications to hacking them. 

I am currently a pentester, or ethical hacker, where I try to hack software for our customers in order to make it more secure. I started with this about a year ago. Before that, I was a software developer. In this post I describe why I switched and how that switch has been.

Developing software is hard. On top of that, as a perfectionist I had high demands on the quality of the software I was building. As part of a team within a company, I did not always have full control over the quality or the development process.  This caused a perpetual frustration, where I was discontent with the product we created but also not in a position to do anything about this.

I switched jobs a couple of times, thinking that the company I worked for was a rotten apple and that another company would surely do things better. This turned out not to be the case. On my last job, I got burned out. I got coaching from someone from HR who helped me to look at my work situation. This made me realize that me and programming are not the match I used to think we were.

I am pretty good at programming. I like creating things out of nothing and learning all the intracasies and patterns of a programming language. It is just that making your own little program is a lot different from developing large software in a company.

So, I decided to no longer do programming, but for some time I didn't know what to do instead. I thought of becoming a researcher, or designing robots or assembly lines. However, I found something that matches both my history as developer of web applications and my skills of precise, innovative and keen to learn. I became a pentester.

Pentesting is pretty different from development. First of all, the projects are a lot shorter. I now have projects of a couple of days up to several weeks. I test the application, write a report, sometimes have a findings meeting, and then the project is finished. This is different from software engineering, where projects can be months or even years. This makes the work a lot more diverse, and if you are frustrated with something in the current project, you can just wait it out. Projects are also often time-boxed, so there are less issues with planning overrun.

There is also a different load on your brain. With programming, you need to stay focused and keep a big part of the program state in your short term memory. With hacking, not so much. Hacking also takes concentrated effort, but this takes less energy from me than when developing. The taxation on the mind is different, if that makes sense.

The experience with web applications that I gained when developing them really helped when learning how to hack them. My experience "on the other side" often helps me to quickly recognize how an application is constructed, and where the weak points are.

However, when I started I was pretty new to the security specialization, and this made it hard for my employer to rate my experience. I was a security novice, but a web application expert. How is my employer going to rate my total experience on web application security? This continues to be an issue with some more meritocratic coworkers. It was also an issue when negotiating my starting salary. Initially, I took quite the pay cut, but this quickly rose to a level comparable to what I earned before.

There is very much to learn about hacking web applications, and even more about information security in general. I really like learning new things, and this switch gave me new opportunity to do so. I strive to be very good at what I do, and this is a possibility in my current position. The value of the end product in security is greatly determined by the most talented pentester. In software it is greatly influenced by the worst developer.

One reason I started this blog was to help me learn, because if you describe something you have to really internalize the knowledge. This blog also makes me feel more part of the security community. I have more of a voice for when somebody is wrong on the Internet.

One thing I miss is creating things. A developer creates new software or functionality, but a hacker only breaks things. This art of making something out of nothing used to be a part of my job that I liked, and I miss it a little bit. However, I still program occassionaly, and I started woodworking.



## I grew tired of what I did

For about 10 years I used to be a developer of web applications.

### Different work load

When developing web applications I needed to be intensely concentrated. When programming you need to keep a lot of the state of the program in your mind. With hacking, not so much. Occasionally there is a complex series of requests, are you have some code with a vulnerability in it. But this doesn't compare to changing a complex piece of software. The taxation on the mind is different.

* Less concentration needed
* Less frustration with tools or current state

### Project duration

Hacking projects typically take days or a couple of weeks, compared to several months or sometimes years for developing of software.

* Shorter projects
* Time-boxed projects, that never go over alotted time

### Part of the community

* More involved in community

### Just breaking things

* Missing creating things
* Lack of automation

## Transition

* Advantage that you have been on the other side
* How developing webapps helps me hacking them
* Hard to judge experience
